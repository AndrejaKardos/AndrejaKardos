**Can you describe yourself a bit?**

  I'm a progress-focused person, who thrives on learning and improvement. There's nothing more satisfying to me than solving a tricky problem, or finding a way to improve myself and the systems I work with. I value curiosity and deep understanding, so I spend a lot of my time understanding how everything works and why. I approach everything in life with a mindset of continuous improvement.
  Outside of coding, I enjoy a mix of hobbies. I love walks and weight-lifting, and there's always some type of educational content or gadget within my reach I'm fiddling with. I love tinkering with projects like Lego Mindstorm robots and Arduino, or just trying to get faster at solving Rubik's cubes. When I'm not building something, you'll find me spending time with my partner and friends, playing video games or board games, or just having a chat about anything and everything. I love a good conversation, expecially when they lead to fresh ideas and new perspectives.

**Where are you from?**

  I'm from Slovenia, Europe. I permanently moved to Melbourne in 2019 to live with my partner (now husband). 

<br>
      
**What did you study?**

  I originally studied maths in Slovenia, which had some coding subjects that I really enjoyed. The plan was always to pursue some form of computer science or programming in addition to maths.
  I decided to pursue a degree in frontend development right before I moved to Australia, with the plan to become a full-stack software engineer.
