**Where are you from?**

  I'm from a small country in Europe called Slovenia, full of beautiful greenery and sights. I've been able to call Melbourne my home since 2019, which was the year I moved across the globe to live with my partner (now husband).

<br>
      
**What did you study?**

  I originally studied maths in Slovenia, which had some coding subjects that I really enjoyed. The plan was always to pursue some form of computer science or programming in addition to maths.
  I decided to pursue a degree in frontend development before I moved to Australia, with the plan being to become fullstack.
