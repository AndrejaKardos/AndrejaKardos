                                                             --- * ---

1. Can you describe yourself a bit? 

      I am a very passionate and energetic person, who spends a lot of her free time trying to achieve goals and improve. 
      This goes for hobbies too, not just coding and work! I am super driven and motivated, so I'm always doing something, 
      and I tend to plan ahead in advance. It's a great source of joy when I set goals and achieve them, even small ones. :)

2. How do you pronounce your name?!

      Andreja = ahn-DRE-yah 

      Kardoš = CAR-dosh

3. Where are you from? 

      I'm a citizen of Slovenia, a small country in Europe. I'm Slavic, hence the crazy name, haha. 
      I moved to Australia in 2019 to be with my Australian partner. :)

4. What do you do?

      I'm currently a junior frontend developer!
      
5. What did you study? 

      I originally studied pure mathematics in Slovenia, which had some coding subjects that I really enjoyed. 
      I decided to get a degree in frontend development when I moved to Australia. 
      
6. What languages do you speak and how did you learn them?

      * Prekmurščina (mother tongue)
      * Slovenian
      * German
      * English
 
      I come from a region in Slovenia called Prekmurje. We speak in 'prekmurski' tongue there, but Slovenian is still our country's official language. 
      German and English happened by watching anime and cartoons for many years without subtitles! Brains are amazing, huh? 
      
7. What coding languages and frameworks do you know? 

      I have learned and am improving on:
      
          * Javascript, HTML and CSS
          * ReactJS (vanilla version, and React Hooks)
          * Typescript
          * SQL
          * Bootstrap
          * REST APIs
      
      But I'd also like to learn this in the future: 
      
          * Java
          * C++, C#, C
          * Node.js
          * More about databases & how to implement them along with frontend
