1. Can you describe yourself a bit? 

      I am a very passionate and energetic person, who spends a lot of her free time achieving goals and trying to improve. 
      This goes for hobbies too, not just coding and work! I am super driven and motivated, so I'm always doing something, 
      and I tend to plan ahead in advance. It's a great source of joy when I set goals and achieve them, even small ones. :)

2. How do you pronounce your name?!

      Andreja = ahn-DRE-yah 

      Kardoš = CAR-dosh

3. Where are you from? 

      I'm a citizen of Slovenia, a small country in Europe. I'm Slavic, hence the crazy name, haha. 
      I moved to Melbourne in 2019 to be with my Australian partner. :)

4. What do you do?

      I'm currently a junior frontend developer! But my plan is to become fullstack + acquire iOS and/or Android knowledge :D
      
5. What did you study? 

      I originally studied pure mathematics in Slovenia, which had some coding subjects that I really enjoyed. 
      I decided to get a degree in frontend development when I moved to Australia. 
      
6. What coding languages and frameworks do you know? 

      I have learned and am improving on:
      
          * Typescript
          * Javascript
          * HTML and CSS
          * React (vanilla and with React Hooks)
          * SQL
          * Bootstrap
          * REST APIs
      
      But I'd also like to learn these in the future: 
      
          * Java
          * C++, C#, C
          * Node.js
          * More about databases & how to implement them along with frontend
          * SWIFT
          * Making Arduino & Raspberry Pi projects
