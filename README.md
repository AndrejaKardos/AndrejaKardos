**Can you describe yourself a bit?**

  I'm all about learning, improving, and solving problems — whether it's in my work or in life. I love diving deep to understand how things work and figuring out how to make things better all the time. When I'm not coding, I'm either lifting weights, reading books, tinkering with gadgets, or trying to beat my Rubik's cube time. I also love spending time with my partner and friends, playing video games, tabletop games, or just having good conversations.

**Where are you from?**

  I'm from Slovenia, Europe. I permanently moved to Melbourne in 2019 to live with my partner (now husband). 

<br>
      
**What did you study?**

  I originally studied maths in Slovenia, where the curriculum covered a substantial amount of computer science subjects. The plan was always to pursue some form of computer science or programming in addition to maths, so I decided to pursue a degree in frontend development as I moved to Australia, with the plan to become a well-rounded full-stack software engineer down the line.
